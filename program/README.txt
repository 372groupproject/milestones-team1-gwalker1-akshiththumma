Our program is a calculator that performs some basic math operations as well as some array/matrix operations

type "make" to run the program.

it uses text based prompting, so just type an operation you want to perform and you will be prompted for more input based on the operation type.

I had attempted to incorporate a linked list I wrote but when trying to add nodes in a loop, it breaks for some reason that I haven't sussed out yet. It works fine outside the loop (as evidenced by the snippet that uses it) but I couldn't sink more time into sorting out the issue. So, long and sad story short, the linked list was tossed.
