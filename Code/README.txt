\f0\fs24 \cf0 Typing \'93make\'94 will build and run the two code snippets and typing \'93make clean\'94 will remove executables.\
\
The first program is a simple hello world that prints \'93Hello, World!\'94\
\
The second program is fizzbuzz which prints the first 100 numbers. If the number is divisible by 3 we print \'93fizz\'94, if it is divisible by 5 we print \'93buzz\'94, if it is divisible by both 3 and 5 we print \'93fizzbuzz\'94.\
\
All of the p2_ prefixed programs demonstrate different control structures.\
\
p2_mildlyuse requires the user to enter a word. Upon receiving the word, it will display the length of the word, the number of vowels, and the number of consonants. It does extremely limited input validation (checks for spaces in the string).\
\
All p3_ prefixed programs demonstrate the different data types. The \'93mildly useful\'94 program is an integer linked list that performs various operations. The nodes are a derived type. The operations are insert, remove, search, and sumList.\
\
The p4_ prefixed programs demonstrate modularity and the different tools available for it. These include subroutines, functions, modules, and interfaces.\
\
The p5_ prefixed programs demonstrate some of the unique aspects of FORTRAN. These include the languages case insensitivity, auto deallocation, and a lot of array info/operations.}
